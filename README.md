# taxi-v3-experiment

## Attempts to solve OpenAI Gym's Taxi-v3 RL environment

The skeleton of this code is from [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/lab-taxi).  Their version uses Taxi-v2, but this version uses v3, since v2 is deprecated.

The environment is from [here](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Taxi-v3/)

To do the simple demo, on Linux or Mac with Docker installed, make `taxi.sh` executable and run it:
```
git clone https://github.com/andyharless/openai-gym-taxi-v3-udacity.git
cd openai-gym-taxi-v3-udacity
chmod u+x taxi.sh
./taxi.sh
```
